#### 1. KINGDOM COME

   ![Kingdom Come](http://www.oconowocc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Kingdom_Come_Action_Figures_1024x768.jpg)

   经典的美漫 DC世界背景。超人蝙蝠侠都老了。
  
         That hope is the brightest ... when it dawns from fear.
  
#### 2. Pyongyang A journey in North Korea
   
![Pyongyang](http://smithsonianapa.org/bookdragon/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2011/03/Pyongyang.jpg)

          DICTATORSHIP MEANS SHUT UP,DEMOCRACY MEANS KEEP TALKING 

    这漫画其实意思并不大，可以说是日记形式。朝鲜是个熟悉又陌生的国家

#### 3. V for Vendetta

    People shouldn’t be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.

    The past can’t hurt you anymore, not unless you let it

    Happiness is the most insidious prison of all.

    Artists use lies to tell the truth. Yes, I created a lie. But because you believed it, you found something true about yourself

    Love your rage, not your cage.

    Remember , Remember the 5th of November of gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gun powder treason should ever be forgot   
       (看到这句就想笑)

    God is in the rain.
      (赞同)

    Anarchy means "without leaders", not "without order". With anarchy comes an age or ordnung, of true order, which is to say voluntary order... this age of ordung will begin when the mad and incoherent cycle of verwirrung that these bulletins reveal has run its course... This is not anarchy, Eve. This is chaos

    Equality and freedom are not luxuries to lightly cast aside. Without them, order cannot long endure before approaching depths beyond imagining

    There's no flesh or blood within this cloak to kill. There's only an idea. Ideas are bulletproof


给我最大印象的倒不是作者对anarchy的颂歌，而是对人的觉醒和V的为师之道的描绘
好像国内出了简体正式版。这漫真不是给小孩看的。
