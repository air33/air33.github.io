1. Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.Disceverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used?What do all the different controls and settings mean?
2. Discoverability re-
   sults from appropriate application of five fundamental psycholog-
   ical concepts covered in the next few chapters: affordances, signifiers,
   constraints, mappings, and feedback. But there is a sixth principle,
   perhaps most important of all: the conceptual model of the system.
   It is the conceptual model that provides true understanding
3. An affor-
   dance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the
   capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could
   possibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore,
   affords sitting. 
4. If an affordance or anti-affordance
   cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is re-
   quired: I call this property a signifier 
5. Knobs afford turning, pushing, and pulling. Slots are for in-
   serting things into. Balls are for throwing or bouncing. Perceived
   affordances help people figure out what actions are possible with-
   out the need for labels or instructions. I call the signaling compo-
   nent of affordances signifier
6. Affordances determine what actions are
   possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place.
7. the term
   signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that
   communicates appropriate behavior to a person
8. Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and
   how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they
   fail to function
9. Communication is
   a key to good design. And a key to
   communication is the signifier.
10. Mapping is a technical term, borrowed from mathematics, mean-
    ing the relationship between the elements of two sets of things.
