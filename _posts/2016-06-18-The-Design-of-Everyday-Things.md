1. Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used?What do all the different controls and settings mean?
2. Discoverability re-
   sults from appropriate application of five fundamental psycholog-
   ical concepts covered in the next few chapters: affordances, signifiers,
   constraints, mappings, and feedback. But there is a sixth principle,
   perhaps most important of all: the conceptual model of the system.
   It is the conceptual model that provides true understanding
3. An affor-
   dance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the
   capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could
   possibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore,
   affords sitting. 
4. If an affordance or anti-affordance
   cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is re-
   quired: I call this property a signifier 
5. Knobs afford turning, pushing, and pulling. Slots are for in-
   serting things into. Balls are for throwing or bouncing. Perceived
   affordances help people figure out what actions are possible with-
   out the need for labels or instructions. I call the signaling compo-
   nent of affordances signifier
6. Affordances determine what actions are
   possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place.
7. the term
   signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that
   communicates appropriate behavior to a person
8. Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and
   how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they
   fail to function
9. Communication is
   a key to good design. And a key to
   communication is the signifier.
10. Mapping is a technical term, borrowed from mathematics, mean-
    ing the relationship between the elements of two sets of things.
11. Feedback has to be planned. All actions need to be confirmed,
but in a manner that is unobtrusive. Feedback must also be prior-
itized, so that unimportant information is presented in an unob-
trusive fashion, but important signals are presented in a way that
does capture attention. 
12. A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified,
of how something works. It doesn’t have to be complete or even
accurate as long as it is useful.
13. Conceptual models are valuable in providing understanding, in
predicting how things will behave, and in figuring out what to do
when things do not go as planned. A good conceptual model allows
us to predict the effects of our actions. Without a good model, we op-
erate by rote, blindly
14. The designer’s conceptual model is the designer’s conception of the look, feel,
and operation of a product. The system image is what can be derived from the physical structure that has been built (including documentation). The user’s
mental model is developed through interaction with the product and the system
image. Designers expect the user’s model to be identical to their own, but because they cannot communicate directly with the user, the burden of communication is with the system image
15. When people use something, they face two gulfs: the Gulf of Exe-
cution, where they try to figure out how it operates, and the Gulf
of Evaluation, where they try to figure out what happened (Fig-
ure 2.1). The role of the designer is to help people bridge the
two gulfs.
16. Seven stages of action: one for goals, three for
execution, and three for evaluation
     a. Goal (form the goal) 
     b. Plan (the action) 
     c. Specify (an action sequence) 
     d. Perform (the action sequence)
     e. Perceive (the state of the world)
     f. Interpret (the perception)
     g. Compare (the outcome with the goal)
17. Most innovation is done as an incremental enhancement of
existing products.What about radical ideas, ones that introduce
new product categories to the marketplace? These come about by
reconsidering the goals, and always asking what the real goal is:
what is called the root cause analysis
18. and we like to think we understand ourselves. But the truth is, we don’t. Most of human behavior is a result of subconscious processes. We are
unaware of them. As a result, many of our beliefs about how people behave—including beliefs about ourselves—are wrong. 
19. Cognition and emotion cannot be separated. Cognitive thoughts lead to emotions: emotions drive cognitive thoughts. The brain is structured to act
upon the world, and every action carries with it expectations, and
these expectations drive emotions. 
20. A human without a working emotional system has difficulty making choices. A
human without a cognitive system is dysfunctional.
21. More and more evidence is accumulating that
we use logic and reason after the fact, to justify our decisions to
ourselves (to our conscious minds) and to others.
22. DESIGN MUST TAKE PLACE AT ALL LEVELS:VISCERAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND REFLECTIVE
23. The real point of these examples is not that some people have erroneous beliefs; it is that everyone forms stories (conceptual models) to explain what they have observed. In the absence of external
information, people can let their imagination run free as long as
the conceptual models they develop account for the facts as they
perceive them. 
24. **When we do this, we tend to attribute our behavior
to the environment. When we see others do it, we tend to attribute
it to their personalities.** ...Just the opposite attribution, by
the way, is made when things go well. When things go right, peo-
ple credit their own abilities and intelligence. The onlookers do
the reverse. When they see things go well for someone else, they
sometimes credit the environment, or luck.
25. We need to remove the word failure from our vocabulary, replacing it instead with learning experience. To fail is to learn: we learn
more from our failures than from our successes. With success, sure,
we are pleased, but we often have no idea why we succeeded. With
failure, it is often possible to figure out why, to ensure that it will
never happen again.
26. Fail often,fail fast
27. Designers should strive to minimize the chance of inappropriate actions in the first place by using affordances, signifiers,
good mapping, and constraints to guide the actions. If a person
performs an inappropriate action, the design should maximize
the chance that this can be discovered and then rectified. This
requires good, intelligible feedback coupled with a simple, clear
conceptual model. When people understand what has happened,
what state the system is in, and what the most appropriate set of
actions is, they can perform their activities more effectively
28. The seven-stage model of the action cycle can be a valuable de-
sign tool, for it provides a basic checklist of questions to ask. In
general, each stage of action requires its own special design strate-
gies and, in turn, provides its own opportunity for disaster. 
     1. What do I want to accomplish?
     2. What are the alternative action sequences?
     3. What action can I do now?
     4. How do I do it?
     5. What happened?
     6. What does it mean?
     7. Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?
29. The information that helps answer questions of execution (do-
ing) is feedforward. The information that aids in understanding
what has happened is feedback. Everyone knows what feedback is.
It helps you know what happened. But how do you know what
you can do? That’s the role of feedforward, a term borrowed from
control theory
30.  seven fundamental principles of design:
     1. Discoverability. It is possible to determine what actions are possible
     and the current state of the device.
     2. Feedback. There is full and continuous information about the results
     of actions and the current state of the product or service. After an
     action has been executed, it is easy to determine the new state.
     3. Conceptual model. The design projects all the information needed
     to create a good conceptual model of the system, leading to under-
     standing and a feeling of control. The conceptual model enhances
     both discoverability and evaluation of results.
     4. Affordances. The proper affordances exist to make the desired ac-
     tions possible.
     5. Signifiers. Effective use of signifiers ensures discoverability and that
     the feedback is well communicated and intelligible.
     6. Mappings. The relationship between controls and their actions fol-
     lows the principles of good mapping, enhanced as much as possible
     through spatial layout and temporal contiguity.

     7. Constraints. Providing physical, logical, semantic, and cultural con-
     straints guides actions and eases interpretation.
