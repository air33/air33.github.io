好久没更新。最近碰到一首挺有意思的诗，记一下。

####Samurai Song
by Robert Pinsky

    When I had no roof I made
    Audacity my roof. When I had
    No supper my eyes dined.

    When I had no eyes I listened.
    When I had no ears I thought.
    When I had no thought I waited.
    
    When I had no father I made
    Care my father. When I had
    No mother I embraced order.
    
    When I had no friend I made
    Quiet my friend. When I had no
    Enemy I opposed my body.
    
    When I had no temple I made
    My voice my temple. I have
    No priest, my tongue is my choir.
    
    When I have no means fortune
    Is my means. When I have
    Nothing, death will be my fortune.
    
    Need is my tactic, detachment
    Is my strategy. When I had
    No lover I courted my sleep.


顺手翻译：

    若我没了屋顶 大胆
    是我屋顶。 若我没了
    晚餐 我的眼睛用餐
     
    若我没了眼睛，我听
    若我没了耳朵，我思
    若我没了点子，我等
     
    若我没了父亲 在意
    是我父亲 若我没了
    母亲，我去拥抱条理
     
    若我没了朋友 平静
    是我朋友， 若我没了
    敌人，我与身体抗争
     
    若我没了神殿 发言
    是我神殿。 没有祭司
    我的舌头是唱诗班
     
    当我没有生计，运气
    是我生计。一无所有
    时 死就是我的运气
     
    需求是我战术，超然
    是我战略，当我没了
    爱人 我求爱于睡眠
